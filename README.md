# School Management System
This repository contains a comprehensible and user-friendly  School Management System.
A school can be modeled as a set of classes and objects with various relationships, such as inheritance and composition. In this project, there are the Student and Teacher classes wich inherit from the Person class. The Course class, exhibits a composition relationship with the Lab class (can be lab equipment or just usual classroom furniture). Student, Teacher and Admin belong to the Person superclass, thus having common elements, such as name, last name and address. However, each of those subclasses has their very own attributes and methods. In this way, the project allows to create and update a database with the information of students, teachers, courses, and equipment.

Within the repository, you can find the files needed for execution. Thanks for visiting!
