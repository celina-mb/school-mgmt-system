# school-mgmt-system
This repository contains a comprehensible and user-friendly  School Management System.
This problem seems interesting to me, as a school has a whole lot of different "actors" which can have different roles. For instance, there are professors, classes, students, attendance, directors, among others. They all interact in different ways and the information related to every "actor" changes. Therefore, I find that a School Management System can be a great first project to apply the principles of Object Oriented Programming.

For example, a student is assigned to a various number of courses, has a student ID and for every course assigned, has attendance and grades. In this way, there is a lot of information related to a student. I would also like to find a way to filter the information a user has access, so that students and parents can consult the gradebook but not edit its contents.
